# Lamplight Redesign ARCHIVE - feedback

## Update 22/5/2025

While there are still things we'll be working on to improve, we're now going to wind down this repository. It's been incredibly helpful through the redesign period, but we now need to move these types of requests and feedback into our "everyday" processes. From now on, if you identify any issues please raise them in the Help system of Lamplight and someone in the team will respond there. 

Issues still live here will be resolved and updated, so we're not closing this down completely just yet. But please don't open new ones here from now on.

Thank you ;)


## Code of Conduct

Thank you for taking the time to test and feed back. We want to make sure that doing so is a positive experience for you and so we've adopted a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/LamplightCRM/feedback?tab=coc-ov-file#readme) for everyone using this repository.

## Any issues or questions you don't want to put here?

Please email redesign@lamplightdb.co.uk. If you have a screenshot with PII please create a Hub question in the current system.
