# Lamplight Redesign - feedback

This is the place we'll be storing any issues identified by our early testers for the redesigned Lamplight. The advantage of doing so here is that you'll be able to see other issues people have raised, and contribute to any discussions where there might be harder questions to resolve.

## Adding a new issue

If you've found something that doesn't seem to work please [raise an issue](https://github.com/LamplightCRM/feedback/issues/new/choose) and add as much information as possible. Ideally, take a look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/LamplightCRM/feedback/issues) first so we don't end up with duplicates.

**THIS IS A PUBLIC SITE. DO NOT PASTE SCREENSHOTS THAT HAVE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**

If you have a few issues, it would be very helpful if you can add them as separate issues.

## What then

We will review these as promptly as we can and either
 - fix it
 - ask you questions / add comments
 - combine it with another if it seems similar
 - suggest that we can't do it right now but would like to in the future

If there are questions that need further discussion we may bring them back to the follow up webinar for broader discussion.


## Code of Conduct

Thank you for taking the time to test and feed back. We want to make sure that doing so is a positive experience for you and so we've adopted a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/LamplightCRM/feedback?tab=coc-ov-file#readme) for everyone using this repository.

## Any issues or questions you don't want to put here?

Please email redesign@lamplightdb.co.uk. If you have a screenshot with PII please create a Hub question in the current system.
